# My C++ Developer Repository

This repository showcases my experience as a C++ developer, and contains code and projects that reflect my skills and knowledge in the language. It includes three folders with different implementations.

## OmegaUp

In the OmegaUp folder, you will find my solutions to various programming contest problems. These solutions showcase my ability to apply C++ concepts and algorithms to solve different types of problems.

## Implementations

The Implementations folder contains various advanced algorithms that I have implemented using C++. These include binary indexed tree, heapsort, Bellman-Ford, and others. These implementations demonstrate my understanding of data structures and algorithms in C++.

## TangledNature

The TangledNature folder contains my implementation of the genetic algorithm described in the paper "Tangled Nature: A model of evolutionary ecology". This project demonstrates my ability to apply C++ to complex problems and showcases my understanding of genetic algorithms and parallel computing on supercomputers.

Overall, this repository showcases my expertise in C++ and how I have applied it to solve various problems and implement advanced algorithms.
